# Word-Embedding-algorithm
This repository demonstrates how to use Word Embedding techniques, BOW,TFIDF, Word2Vec, to create meaningful vector representations of words for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In addition to word embeddings, the project includes a basic text preprocessing pipeline to clean and structure the text data before embedding.


**Libraries used**
**nltk** - for natural language processing tasks:

  Install using pip install nltk.
  Commonly used components:
  nltk.corpus.stopwords: Contains a list of stopwords.
  nltk.stem.PorterStemmer and nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer: For stemming and lemmatization.
  gensim - for word embeddings (Word2Vec model):
  Install using pip install gensim.

re - standard Python library for regular expressions; no installation needed.

scikit-learn - for Bag of Words and TF-IDF vectorizers:

Install using pip install scikit-lear
